After running my last blog build in Drupal, and wordpress prior to that, I wanted to give a static site generator a try.

Given the amount of Grunt usage at work the past year, Assemble.io was a great choice.

I was inspired by [Andi Smith](http://www.andismith.com/blog/2014/02/getting-started-with-assemble/)'s great intro to assemble, and borrowed heavily from his site's design as well, though everything was styled // hand coded.

There were a few gotchas (I"m looking at you collections and your contexts), but nothing that a few well placed handlebars helpers can't resolve.

If you'd like to get started, try out the [Yeoman Assemble Generator](https://github.com/assemble/generator-assemble), and give a read through Andi's getting started post.

I'll be posting some of my handlebars helpers and some of my thoughts on additional setup // configuration along the way.
