## Father, Developer, and nerd.
I'm a web developer in NE Arkansas. I currently work for Rockfish Interactive, with a bunch of weirdos I"m lucky to call my friends.

I graduated from a small highschool in NE Arkansas before going on to study Computer Science at ASU. I met my best friend in college, and since I couldn't marry him Sandra & I decided to tie the knot.

I'm an avid reader, mostly enjoying epic fantasy and science fiction. I've been a student of blues guitar for the past year, and though I don't sound good yet it has been a great method of expression.

I play D&D every other weekend with a great group of friends, and enjoy board games of all kinds, as well as PC & console gaming.
